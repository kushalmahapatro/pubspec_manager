# Overview
PUBM, short for Pubspec Manager, is a Dart-Command Line tool created to manage multiple versions of `pubspec.yaml` files in a single project. This tool helps in merging multiple `pubspec.yaml` files into a single `pubspec.yaml` file as per the selected flavor.

## ðŸ“‹ Installation

To install the `pubm` package, add it as a new dev dependency in your `pubspec.yaml` file. Run the following command in your terminal:

```console
PS c:\src\flutter_project> dart pub add --dev pubm
```
For Flutter projects, use:
```console
PS c:\src\flutter_project> flutter pub add --dev pubm
```

## ðŸ“‹ Usage

To manage different versions of pubspec.yaml files, create a new file for each flavor with the name `pubspec_<flavor>.yaml`. When the following command is executed, the pubspec.yaml file is updated with the contents of the `pubspec_<flavor>.yaml` file. This can be used to update, change, or add dependencies and their respective versions, as well as Flutter fonts.

```console  
PS c:\src\flutter_project> dart run pubm:manage -f <flavor>
```
Use the -v flag to print detailed logs (verbose logs) in the console.console.
```console  
PS c:\src\flutter_project> dart run pubm:manage -f <flavor> -v
```
### ðŸ“‹ Example: pubpsec_dev.yaml
Here's an example of a flavor-specific pubspec.yaml file for a 'dev' flavor:
```console
description: dev version of pubspec.yaml
version: 0.0.1-dev

dependencies:
  example_dependency: 
   path: example/dependency

dev_dependencies:
  lints: ^2.1.1
  

flutter:
  fonts:
    - family: font1
      fonts:
        - asset: dev/font1/700.ttf
          weight: 700
        - asset: dev/font1/600.ttf
          weight: 600
        - asset: dev/font1/500.ttf
          weight: 500
        - asset: dev/font1/400.ttf
          weight: 400
    - family: font2
      fonts:
        - asset: dev/font2/700.ttf
          weight: 700
        - asset: dev/font2/600.ttf
          weight: 600
        - asset: dev/font2/500.ttf
          weight: 500
        - asset: dev/font2/400.ttf
          weight: 400
```

The above values present in the pubspec_<flavor>.yaml file will be updated in the pubspec.yaml file, if the same present, else will be added to the pubspec.yaml file.

### ðŸ“‹ Example: pubspec.yaml
Here's an example of the main pubspec.yaml file:
```console
name: pubm
description: Actual description
version: 0.0.1

environment:
  sdk: ^3.0.0

dependencies:
  cupertino_icons: ^1.0.2

flutter:
  uses-material-design: true
  generate: true
  fonts:
    - family: font1
      fonts:
        - asset: actual/font1/700.ttf
          weight: 700
        - asset: actual/font1/600.ttf
          weight: 600
        - asset: actual/font1/500.ttf
          weight: 500
        - asset: actual/font1/400.ttf
          weight: 400
    - family: font2
      fonts:
        - asset: actual/font2/700.ttf
          weight: 700
        - asset: actual/font2/600.ttf
          weight: 600
        - asset: actual/font2/500.ttf
          weight: 500
        - asset: actual/font2/400.ttf
          weight: 400
```

After running the below command, the output pubspec.yaml file will be as follows:
##### Command:
```console
dart run pubm:manage -f dev
```
##### Output

```console
name: pubm
description: dev version of pubspec.yaml
version: 0.0.1-dev

environment:
  sdk: ^3.0.0

dependencies:
  # normal dependencies
  cupertino_icons: ^1.0.2
  # path related dependencies
  example_dependency: 
   path: example/dependency

dev_dependencies:
  # normal dev_dependencies
  lints: ^2.1.1

flutter:
  uses-material-design: true
  generate: true
  fonts:
    - family: font1
      fonts:
        - asset: dev/font1/700.ttf
          weight: 700
        - asset: dev/font1/600.ttf
          weight: 600
        - asset: dev/font1/500.ttf
          weight: 500
        - asset: dev/font1/400.ttf
          weight: 400
    - family: font2
      fonts:
        - asset: dev/font2/700.ttf
          weight: 700
        - asset: dev/font2/600.ttf
          weight: 600
        - asset: dev/font2/500.ttf
          weight: 500
        - asset: dev/font2/400.ttf
          weight: 400
```

By default, this tool also sorts the dependencies and dev_dependencies in alphabetical order by category. The categories are as follows:
1. git related dependencies
2. path related dependencies
3. normal dependencies
4. hosted dependencies
5. sdk dependencies
